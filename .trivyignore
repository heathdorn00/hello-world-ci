# CVE-2023-45853: zlib integer overflow
# Status: will_not_fix in Debian base image (as of 2025-11-07)
# Reason: This vulnerability is marked as will_not_fix by the Debian security team.
#         It requires a crafted input that would trigger integer overflow in zlib
#         compression functions. Our application does not process untrusted compressed
#         data that would expose this vulnerability.
# Impact: Low for this application (no user-controlled compression input)
# Mitigation: Input validation at application layer; consider alternative base images
# Added: 2025-11-07
